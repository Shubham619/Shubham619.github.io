Contributor of opensource Scalable Memory Development Kit for heterogeneous memory. The toolkit thus reduces the burden of introducing new memory and allows users to quickly reap the benefits of heterogeneous memory. The SMDK is developed for the Samsung CXL (Compute Express Link) Memory Expander devices to enable a full-stack Software-Defined Memory system.
