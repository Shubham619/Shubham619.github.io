_**Abstract**_ -- During manufacturing of memory devices, there may be various defects which may be introduced at multiple stages of manufacturing such as fabrication, production and testing. These defects such as assembly line defects, external defects, equipment or process defects, may results in the failure of that memory device and may be identified using automated or manual mass production tests. For large-scale manufacturing, manual inspection of these defects is time-inefficient and error-prone. This process of identifying probable causes of failure in embedded memory devices is known as suspect recommendation. In this paper, a machine learning approach to identify defective device lots from non-defective device lots is proposed.
